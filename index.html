                        Our company was responsible for creating a Windows application that would create and manage data related to log scaling. 
                        This required one application to be used for data entry of log information and another application to be used for managing 
                        the contracts and locations of the truckloads of those logs.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Entering the Data</h3>
                    <p>
                        The methodology of scaling a log is a complicated process, but essentially log scalers enter information about the log, 
                        like length and diameter. This information is then used to determine how much of the log can be used. It was our job to create 
                        an application that could calculate this data in real time and store it in an efficient manner. We deployed this as a Universal 
                        Windows Platform application so that it would be accessible with the hardware they would need. I was responsible for building the 
                        UI for this application, debugging any issues, developing feature requests, and increasing performance. Since this was being used 
                        in a production environment, it was critical that I understood the issues users were experiencing and provide a timely solution.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Storing the Data</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since the information needed for log scaling can change drastically, we stored the data in a NoSQL database through Couchbase. 
                        This would allow us to update schemas as needed while still handling large volumes of data. I was tasked with building, deploying, 
                        and maintaining the database. Project owners would often have questions about data and it was my role to create the queries needed 
                        to provide the answer. Queries were also required for any changes to our data model that required updates to historical data, which 
                        I was responsible for writing. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Accessing the Data</h3>
                    <p>
                        Due to the nature of the production environment, we had to allow for offline entry of data that could then be synced later on. While 
                        Couchbase offers their Sync Gateway to handle this, we still had to implement our own merge strategies for data integrity. I took the 
                        steps necessary to to deploy the Sync Gateway and make it available to all users. I did this through the Google Cloud Platform. To 
                        keep the application secure, I integrated the Sync Gateway with Auth0. I diagnosed and worked through any issues that arose in our 
                        syncing process.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Organizing the Data</h3>
                    <p>
                        The information of the logs needed to be organized under different contracts, which required a separate application. This was built in 
                        Xamarin Forms to allow for the most flexibility in our deployment environment. Similar to the log entry application, I was responsible 
                        for building the UI for this application, debugging any issues, developing feature requests, and increasing performance. To track the 
                        bugs and feature requests, I initiated our use of Jira to manage communication between the clients.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Testing the Data</h3>
                    <p>
                        The rules of log scaling have existed for quite some time. To ensure that our program followed those same standards, the auditing 
                        process for these applications had to be robust. I created and reported on unit tests involved with our calculations for log scaling 
                        and for our own applications stability.
